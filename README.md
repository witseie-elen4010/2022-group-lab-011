## **Description:**
Wordle World Party is a multiplayer version of the popular Wordle game. Our game also has a solo mode where you can play an unlimited amount of games a day.

In the multiplayer mode, its a 1v1 game against an opponent on the internet, and you compete to see who can get the correct word in as little guesses as possible. An exciting feature is the ability to be involved in the multiplayer game as an 'ADMIN'. The 'ADMIN' decides what word the 2 players need to guess and can view the match occurring in real time!

We have added features to our game that include a detailed Game Log for both individual and multiplayer games so that you can retrospectively study the game as it occured, your specific word guesses, and the final correct word that you were aiming to get.

We also have the much anticipated ranking system where you need to compete to climb the ranks. The ranking table is based on your win percentage of your multiplayer games.

## **Development:**

Node.js is used for a web server in conjunction with the Express framework. Socket.io is used for the multiplayer communication.
For the front-end, Bootstrap component library is used. Three.js was used for the landing page. Microsoft’s
Azure platform is used for deployment. A persistent data store was setup using Microsoft’s SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Continous testing was done using Jest and Puppyteer which was automated on GitHub Actions.

## **Summary:**

The development of this web based multiplayer game occurred over 4 weeks. Each week within the production was defined as a Sprint in order to complete the 4 Sprint production cycle. A comprehensive folder full of all the documents relating to each Sprint along with documents such as our Architectural Decision Records and Project Conventions is presented. Please find the Game Images below that are screenshots of the different pages and situations within the game.
