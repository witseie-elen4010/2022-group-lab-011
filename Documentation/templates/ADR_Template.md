This is the template inÂ Documenting architecture decisions

In each ADR file, write these sections:

## Title
	These documents are numbered in order. They have names that are short noun phrases. For example, "ADR 1: 	Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10" or "ADR 9: LDAP for Multitenant Integration"

## Status
	What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

## Context
	This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. 	These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. It is simply describing facts.

## Decision
	What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. 	"We will ..."

## Consequences
	This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. What becomes easier or more 		difficult to do because of this change?
