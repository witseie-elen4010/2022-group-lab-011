Please Note:

Story maps and SCRUM boards were designed in Jira, where user stories are given titles 
and descriptions. Titles identify the user story and descriptions contain the actual story
itself. What is visible in both the Story Map and SCRUM board is the title of the user 
story and not the full story itself.

For a view of the full story see the git hub SCRUM board.
